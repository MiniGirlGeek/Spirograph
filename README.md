# Spirograph

**Warning:** this was created as a product of procrastination, so it's probably not the neatest or the most efficient, however it does create pretty rainbow patterns.

Cool examples to try:

```python
x, y =  angle_to_point(angle_to_point([WIDTH/2,HEIGHT/2], 100, a*5), 100, a*0.25)
```
